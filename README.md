This case study on ARP spoofing via Wi-Fi breach illustrates a classic but frequently underestimated threat vector in network security. The attacker, by first breaching the Wi-Fi perimeter, positions themselves inside the trusted broadcast domain, bypassing traditional edge defenses. From this internal vantage point, they execute a silent yet potent ARP spoofing attack, a technique that poisons the ARP caches of local devices and misroutes their traffic through the attacker’s system.

Our investigation began with the observation of unsolicited ARP replies in packet captures, reinforced by switch logs showing unexpected ARP updates. Recognizing these patterns as indicative of an ARP poisoning attempt, we pivoted to a structured triage approach—first focusing on network telemetry (Wireshark, NetFlow, firewall logs), but soon acknowledging the likely host-based implications and the necessity to consider file system, registry, and volatile memory artifacts if the attack escalates.

Through careful reconstruction, we identified the attacker’s strategic goals: to insert themselves into the network flow undetected, intercept sensitive data, and potentially manipulate traffic in real-time. The gratuitous ARP replies were not random noise but deliberate, spaced attempts to claim control without alerting defenses.

This case reinforces several critical lessons for both CySA+ candidates and practicing defenders:

ARP spoofing is not a relic attack; it remains effective in environments lacking proper defenses like Dynamic ARP Inspection or port security.

Initial access via Wi-Fi breach highlights the importance of strong access controls and network segmentation.

Observability is paramount; even simple tools like packet captures or switch logs can reveal complex attack chains when interpreted correctly.

Cross-layer thinking is essential; what begins as a network-layer event may escalate into host-level compromise, requiring multi-faceted triage and response.

Ultimately, this case is a testament to the attacker’s ability to blend stealth with precision, leveraging protocol vulnerabilities and environmental weaknesses. It reminds defenders that foundational knowledge of network protocols, coupled with systematic triage methodologies, is crucial to early detection and containment.
